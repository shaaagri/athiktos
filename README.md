An open-world sci-fi action adventure that tells the story of an astronaut

through sentient inhabitants, unusual flora and dangerous terrains. 

While ambitious and not completed, the project can boast:
  - Multiple mini-worlds, each with its unique visual style and challenges
  - Atmospheric and immersive setting
  - Variety of player experiences: from survival horror to cultivating friendships with local creatures, and from contemplative exploration to fast-paced action
  - Original music
  - Advanced HFSM-based AI
